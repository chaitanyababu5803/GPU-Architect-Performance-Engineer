GPU Architect/Performance Engineer: Profiling and optimizing power/performance at the hardware and driver levels.
*********************
GPU Architect/Performance Engineer: Profiling and optimizing power/performance at the hardware and driver levels.
GPU Architects and Performance Engineers operate at the intersection of hardware and software to maximize the efficiency of graphics and compute units. Their work involves characterizing system behavior—ranging from idle to active states—to identify bottlenecks and drive "speed-of-light" optimizations for applications like AI, gaming, and high-performance computing.

Core Responsibilities
Hardware-Software Co-Design: Collaborating with silicon architects and driver teams to explore trade-offs between performance, area, and power metrics for next-generation GPUs.
Performance Modeling: Developing cycle-approximate or cycle-accurate C++/Python models to simulate hardware behavior and validate new architectural features before they are built in silicon.
Bottleneck Analysis: Identifying limiters in compute throughput, memory bandwidth, or interconnects (e.g., NVLink, PCIe) using telemetry data and firmware traces.
Driver & Kernel Optimization: Developing critical driver software and custom high-performance kernels (e.g., using CUDA, Triton, or HIP) to improve hardware utilization.
Power Management: Implementing and verifying features like DVFS (Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling), P-states, and thermal throttling to optimize power-per-watt.

Essential Profiling & Optimization Tools
System-Wide Profilers: Tools like NVIDIA Nsight Systems and Intel VTune Profiler provide a holistic view of CPU-GPU interactions and identify if an application is compute-bound or memory-bound.
Kernel-Level Analyzers: NVIDIA Nsight Compute and AMD uProf offer detailed instruction-level metrics and hardware counter analysis within specific GPU kernels.
Monitoring & Debugging: Lower-level utilities like nvidia-smi or nvtop for real-time memory and core utilization, and CUDA-GDB for on-hardware debugging.
Power & Hardware Control: Specialized software like MSI Afterburner for undervolting/overclocking and vendor-specific tools for analyzing P-states and package power limits.
